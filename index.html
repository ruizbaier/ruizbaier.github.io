I am an Associate Professor in Computational Mathematics at Monash University, and an ARC Future Fellow. <br> I am also a member of the Victorian Heart Institute and of the Monash Data Futures Institute.<br><br> My research concentrates on the design and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential  equations, focusing on <br> discretisations that preserve the main features of the underlying natural  phenomena we aim to describe.

<br> 
My areas of interest and expertise include fundamental topics in numerical analysis and scientific computing such as 
<ul>
<li> Analysis of finite volume and finite element methods using mixed and augmented formulations</li>
<li> Space-time adaptivity and error estimation</li>
<!-- <li> Degenerate parabolic equations and reaction-diffusion systems</li> -->
<li> Perturbed saddle-point problems</li>
<li> Multiphase flow and transport in porous media</li>
<!-- <li> Sedimentation-consolidation processes</li> -->
<li> Cardiac electrophysiology and  electromechanics</li>
<li> Interface problems</li>
</ul>
